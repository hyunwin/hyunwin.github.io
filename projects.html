                <p>A text-based RPG that is entirely played through a text interface. The game was primarily created using inheritence, polymorphism, and different types of design patterns. The base class, named Entity, has two difference constructors in which one of them can take an Ability pointer for the hero characters and the other constructor for the enemy characters. My team and I also created tests using Google's Testing and Mocking Framework to ensure that our game functioned properly. Click on the link below to visit the source code for more information. </p>
