                <p> I am a senior at the University of California, Riverside, as a Computer Science major. As a kid, when 3G first came out, I had a fear of being next to smartphones because I thought the radiation would make me more stupid. 
                After getting my first smartphone in the 8th grade, I realized that wireless communication was something amazing that could connect people all over the world through the beautiful craftmanship of both hardware and software. 
                Ever since then, I have been always been interested in software engineering because I thought maybe one day I could be apart of the making of something amazing such as a cell phone.
                In my next job, I would like to help build out the next generation of technology. 
                </p>

                Some of my hobbies include: eating out with my friends, playing video games, and golfing. 
                In addition, I love to learn about new coding languages and applications. Currently, I am learning about ReactJS and Angular.
